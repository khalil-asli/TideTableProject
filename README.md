# TideTableProject

For the Apikey in the mainAcitivity you can get it by creating an account on worldtides website: https://www.worldtides.info/register .

You will have a free quota of 100 call to the api.

If you got an http error in the execution of the code this probably mean that you have no more quota available. So create an account and replace the apikey on MainActivity by a new one.
